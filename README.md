# BarBot
AutoMatic Bartender Source
This was originally based on a project by Yu Jiang Tham
http://yujiangtham.com/2014/05/25/build-your-very-own-drink-mixing-robot-part-1/

We took his idea and used the same electrical and mechanical ideas for the pumps to build a board that would interface
with a Raspberry Pi w/touchscreen. The code to drive the bartender is then written for the Pi in Java
The ultimate goal is a db with all the recipies and configuration so that it may be easily and dynamically 
reconfigured.
